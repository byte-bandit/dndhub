# The Shipâ€™s Captain
The captain of the ship the players initially arrived on has been washed ashore on the beach near the [[Pirate Cove]], where he has been found and rescued by pirate scoundrels which (albeit having been around for some time now) lacked organisation, leadership and control.

The captain quickly saw his opportunity to gain a new powerful position and upraised the ranks to become the new pirate leader.

He remains with his crew in the pirate cove, not far from [[Baecend]] where he will send out his men to pillage the surrounding villages and sometimes even set to the sea again, trying to salvage any averaged ships.
