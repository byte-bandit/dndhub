# Miro
Miro is a male halfling and the cook of the *Deepwater*, the ship on which the players initially crash. He makes it alive to the beach and is the first NPC the players are able to find near the beaches.

Miro will serve as an initial guide and tell the players about [[The survivors]], albeit he wonâ€™t join the players in the rescue mission. 

He is generally good hearted and lawful good.
